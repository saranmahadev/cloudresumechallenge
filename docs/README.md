# Cloud Resume Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud certification to cloud job. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

#### Why doing this?

This project is proposed by [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com/) who has lot of experience in cloud and DevOps and it is a great opportunity to learn and practice the skills that you need to be a cloud/devops engineer.

- Integration with Azure CDN and mapping Subdomain ended in vain because of the limitations of Azure Student Account.

> Took a lot of time in the Azure Portal but later I got the idea to use Azure CLI to configure CDN.

- **GitHub Actions**(CI/CD) was created for the Frontend Branch and Whenever a push is made to the Frontend Branch, the Frontend Branch is deployed to ** Azure Storage**.
