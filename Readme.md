# Cloud Resume Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud certification to cloud job. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

# Why doing this?

This project is proposed by [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com/) who has lot of experience in cloud and DevOps and it is a great opportunity to learn and practice the skills that you need to be a cloud/devops engineer.
